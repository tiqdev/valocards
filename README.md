# 🔴 ValoCards 

ValoCards is a tool for creating custom player cards for Valorant players. You can customize your Valorant player cards in any way you like and download them!

## ⭐️ Customize Your Valorant Experience: Create Personalized Cards with the Game's API 

- Using Valorant's API, you can create personalized cards by selecting from the current titles, agents, ranks, and player cards available in the game, and download them both vertically and horizontally
- The application offers two language options. You can choose titles and rank names in your preferred language.
- I developed this project using the latest version of Next.js along with Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, Redux Toolkit, and Framer Motion.
- The quality of the visuals in the project created by directly taking visuals from the game is not dependent on us.
